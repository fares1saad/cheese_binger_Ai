Me and my team are happy to share that we have officially completed our AI course in college by making a "Connect-4 AI Bot".

This AI agent was implemented using Python, and it's main purpose is to play against any Connect-4 game, and the one we tested on was created by "kevin shannon" on (http://kevinshannon.com/connect4/).

We decided to make the agent use the "Minimax algorithm", in addition to refining it using "Alpha-Beta pruning", in order for it to make the decisions on where to place the piece it is assigned.

Our AI program supports 3 different difficulties, which of course represent the depth to which the decision tree of the implemented algorithm "Minimax" can reach, which can be ither "Easy, Medium, Hard".

Working with my colleagues was a crucial part of this project, as it allowed for division of labor and sharing of expertise. With the aid of GitHub, We were able to delegate tasks such as designing and optimizing the heuristics and evaluation functions, implementing the game logic and testing and debugging the code. This allowed us to work more efficiently and effectively, and achieve better results than we could have individually.
